# NCfiles
This is a script developed in R to read and visualize your NetCDF file.
NetCDF files are large scale datasets normally as Climate Scientist we use them to have larger data sets of global or regional scale and can easily store data. This script will help you not only to visualize your NC file 
but also to make it useful for your analysis

Best of Luck
